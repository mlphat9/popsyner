PopSyner: a conceptual framework for generating synthetic populations

PopSyner integrates a Transformer-based model to generate synthetic populations.
PopSyner leverages both publicly available aggregated and disaggregated data.
This approach enables us to benefit from deep generative methods using disaggregated data as input while incorporating additional attributes from aggregated data.
